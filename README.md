minecraftpimaze
===============

Generates a maze in the raspberry pi edition of minecraft.

If the import statements don't work, either copy the files in mcpi/api/python/mcpi to
the same dir as maze.py, or better still set your PYTHONPATH with something similar
to the following:

export PYTHONPATH=:/home/pi/mcpi/api/python/mcpi:/home/pi/mcpi/api/python/mcpi
